# Additional basic list exercises

# D. Given a list of numbers, return a list where
# all adjacent == elements have been reduced to a single element,
# so [1, 2, 2, 3] returns [1, 2, 3]. You may create a new list or
# modify the passed in list.
def remove_adjacent(nums):
  # +++your code here+++
  """  
  Args:
  numbers: list of numbers

  Returns:
  list: list with adjacent duplicates removed
  """

  return list(set(nums)) # convreting to set removing duplicates then converting to list again. 
                         # Hint: this technique not preserving the order of the list and this not required in the criteria

# E. Given two lists sorted in increasing order, create and return a merged
# list of all the elements in sorted order. You may modify the passed in lists.
# Ideally, the solution should work in "linear" time, making a single
# pass of both lists.
def linear_merge(list1, list2):
  # +++your code here+++
  """
  Args:
  list1: A list of elements sorted in increasing order.
  list2: A list of elements sorted in increasing order.

  Returns:
  list: A merged list of all elements in sorted order.
  """
  # Initialize pointers for both lists
  i, j = 0, 0
  merged_list = []

  # Traverse both lists and merge them
  while i < len(list1) and j < len(list2):
    if list1[i] < list2[j]:
      merged_list.append(list1[i])
      i += 1
    else:
      merged_list.append(list2[j])
      j += 1

  merged_list.extend(list1[i:]) # If there are remaining elements in list1 add them to merged_list
  merged_list.extend(list2[j:]) # If there are remaining elements in list2 add them to merged_list
  
  return merged_list # Hint sorted(list1 + list2) is not a linear solution

# Note: the solution above is kind of cute, but unforunately list.pop(0)
# is not constant time with the standard python list implementation, so
# the above is not strictly linear time.
# An alternate approach uses pop(-1) to remove the endmost elements
# from each list, building a solution list which is backwards.
# Then use reversed() to put the result back in the correct order. That
# solution works in linear time, but is more ugly.
